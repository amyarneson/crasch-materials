```

## Objectives

- Understand the format of the tutorial documents.
- Run commands in `R` directly in the console.
- Run commands in `R` from a script.
- Install the `crasch` package.
- Set a working directory.
- Check that everything has been installed correctly on your system.
- View sample output from your working directory.
- Access a documentation (help files) within RStudio.

## Format of tutorial materials

"Code chunks" appear in grey boxes throughout these materials.  These represent 
*verbatim* the code that you will use in `R`, either in the console or in a 
script.

```{r}
# Anything behind a pound sign is a comment
# Use these to leave notes to your future self or others
##########################################################
### or to break up sections of code

# Comments can exist on their own line
1 + 1 # or at the end of a line of code
```

Output is printed under the code chunk.  As we go along, compare your output to 
that shown in these materials.

## Please note...

Objectives for future tutorials

- Learn to format your own input files.
- Read input files into `R`.
- Change/customize arguments of the `crasch` functions.
- Interpret output.

If you have questions regarding these objectives, you can:

- Check out the slides and sample script files on bCourses for future tutorials.
- See Amy or Yukie during office hours.
- Save questions for future tutorials during class time (parking lot).

# RStudio

```{r, out.width = 800, fig.retina = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/amy/OneDrive/Development/crasch-materials/figures/RStudio-over.png")
```

The *console* is where you will input *commands*.

You open *scripts* in the *Source Window*.

- An R script is like a Stata do file.
- You can save and re-run commands straight from the script.

## Running commands in the console

Type directly into the console.  At the end of each line, press *Enter*.

```{r}
14 + 9

x = 9
14 + x

y = c(9, -9)
14 + y
```

## Running commands from a script

Open a *new*, blank script by clicking on the top left icon (green + sign over 
a white rectangle) and choosing "R Script."

Type the following commands into the script file.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
14 + 11

x = 11
14 + x

y = c(11, -11)
14 + y
```

Run a single line of code by placing the cursor anywhere on that line and 
clicking "Run" in the top right corner.

Run multiple lines by highlighting and clicking "Run."

# The `crasch` package

Note that `R` is a *case sensitive* language, so type exactly as shown.

## Installing `crasch`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# This first package allows you to install from github
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# Now, install crasch
install_github("amyarneson/crasch")
# This may take a few minutes; multiple packages will be installed
# You may see some warning messages, and that's okay!
# You only need to install the package once...
  # ...unless you are instructed to update/re-install by Yukie or 
  # Amy in the future!
```

## Loading the `crasch` package

```{r}
library(crasch)
# This "opens" the crasch package within your R session
# You will need to run the library() command each time you open R
# A few messages and warnings are expected
```

## Setting your working directory

`crasch` will save output to any folder on your computer, but you must tell it 
which folder!

- Click the 'Files' tab of the bottom right window in RStudio.
- Click the '...' button located on the right side.
- Navigate to your chosen folder and open it.
- Click the 'More' button and choose 'Set as working directory.'

Alternately, you can set your working directory with the function `setwd()` if 
you know the complete path to that folder.  Be sure to include quotation marks!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("/Users/Amy/Desktop/project")   # OSX
setwd("C:/Users/Amy/Desktop/project") # Windows
```

## Running a crasch analysis

Run a test analysis using data that is provided with the package install.  This 
data is called `SUP` because it represents the level of **sup**port of teachers 
regarding the adoption of a school-wide writing rubric.  (This data is from 
Amy's class project.)

```{r, message = FALSE}
# It is important to store the results in an R object
tutorial1 = craschR(SUPwide, itemInfo = SUPitem, consInfo = SUPcons, 
                    estPackage = "TAM", writeout = TRUE)
```

- `tutorial1` is the *object* that stores all of the estimation information
- `craschR()` is the *function*
- everything inside the parentheses are called *arguments* to the function

## Viewing ouput

Because we used `writeout = TRUE`, new files that contain the results of your 
analysis should now be in your working directory.

These are saved as CSVs and can be viewed using Excel or your favorite 
spreadsheet program.

You can also view the results in `R`.

```{r}
names(tutorial1)
```

To view your results in the console, use `$`.

```{r}
tutorial1$persPars
```

## Creating and viewing plots/graphs

You will likely use plots to display your analysis results.

```{r, message = FALSE}
wm(tutorial1)
```

The Wright Map should show in the Plots tab.  Click the Zoom button to open it 
in a larger window.

## Saving plots/graphs

You can save the plot as an image using the RStudio menus within the Plots tab.

Alternatively, use `writeout = TRUE` and specify an file type and it will be 
written to your working directory.  You can then include the image in 
presentation slides or other documents.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wm(tutorial1, writeout = TRUE, imageType = "png")
```

# Accessing documentation / help files

You can view documentation in RStudio using "`?`"

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?crasch
?craschR
```
